## Additional ID Type Fixes (Completed - July 28, 2025)

### What was done:
1. **ID Type Consistency**: Fixed remaining issues with ID types across the application:
   - Updated all `.toString()` calls where string IDs were already being used
   - Fixed server-side transformation functions to work properly with string IDs
   - Fixed API routes that were still using `parseInt()` on IDs
   - Updated components to properly handle string IDs

2. **Major Files Updated**:
   - `src/types/server-transforms.ts` - Fixed transformation functions
   - `src/app/management/page.tsx` and `src/app/management/[id]/page.tsx` - Fixed product operations
   - `src/components/products/product-list.tsx` - Updated product handling
   - `src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Fixed organization ID handling
   - `src/app/user-management/page.tsx` - Updated member management
   - `src/components/admin/user-management-table.tsx` - Fixed organization ID usage
   - `src/components/admin/invite-user-dialog.tsx` - Removed parseInt
   - `src/api/organizations/[id]/members/[memberId]/route.ts` - Fixed member routes
   - `src/api/organizations/[id]/members/route.ts` - Fixed organization routes
   - `src/api/user.ts` - Fixed user API functions

### Build status: ✅ PASSING
- All TypeScript errors resolved
- Application builds successfully
- Ready for production deployment

## Database Migration to UUID (Completed - January 28, 2025)

### What was done:
1. **Schema Migration**: Created comprehensive `migration_uuid_v5.sql` script
   - Converts all numeric SERIAL PRIMARY KEY columns to UUID v5
   - Handles all foreign key relationships
   - Includes error handling for existing indexes and constraints
   - Safe to run multiple times (idempotent operations)

2. **Product Hierarchy Restructure**: 
   - Changed from `parent_id` model to `children_ids` array model
   - Updated all API functions to build hierarchical trees using the new structure
   - Modified product types to support the new architecture

3. **UI Components Updated**:
   - Refactored `ProductTreeView` component to use `react-d3-tree` library
   - Updated from nested list to interactive D3 tree visualization
   - Fixed all TypeScript errors across the application

4. **CSV Data Updates**:
   - Generated UUID-compatible CSV files in `/data/*_updated.csv`
   - Maintained data relationships with proper UUID mappings

5. **Type System**:
   - All interfaces updated from `number` to `string` for IDs
   - Fixed mock data and test components
   - Resolved type conflicts throughout the application

### Files created/modified:
- `migration_uuid_v5.sql` - Complete database migration script
- `rollback_uuid_migration.sql` - Rollback script if needed
- `docs/schema.sql` - Updated schema with UUID types
- `src/types/*.ts` - All type definitions updated
- `src/api/product.ts` - Updated for children array structure  
- `src/components/management/product-tree-view.tsx` - Refactored for D3 tree
- Multiple component and page files fixed for UUID compatibility

### Key technical decisions:
- Used UUID v5 for deterministic ID generation
- Maintained backward compatibility where possible
- Added comprehensive error handling in migration script
- Used react-d3-tree@3.6.6 for modern tree visualization

### Build status: ✅ PASSING
- All TypeScript errors resolved
- Application builds successfully
- Ready for production deployment after running migration script
