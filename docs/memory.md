## getSupplierTree - React-D3-Tree Compatible Implementation (Completed - August 1, 2025)

### What was done:
1. **Refactored to getSupplierTree**: Renamed and restructured `getCompleteProductTree` to `getSupplierTree`:
   - Returns data structure directly compatible with react-d3-tree format
   - Uses `name` and `attributes` structure expected by react-d3-tree
   - Includes comprehensive product attributes in the `attributes` object
   - Eliminates need for client-side data transformation

2. **React-D3-Tree Compatible Data Structure**: 
   ```typescript
   {
     name: string,
     attributes: {
       productId: string,
       sku: string,
       type: string,
       category: string,
       description: string,
       quantity: number,
       unit: string,
       status: string
     },
     children?: [...] // Optional nested children in same format
   }
   ```

3. **Server-side Recursive Implementation**:
   - Recursively fetches all `children_ids` using `getProductById`
   - Builds complete multi-layer tree structure
   - Stops recursion when no more children exist
   - Includes loop prevention with visited set
   - Returns tree ready for direct import to react-d3-tree

4. **Updated Component Integration**:
   - Modified `supplier-tree-view.tsx` to use `useGetSupplierTree` hook
   - Simplified data handling since server returns react-d3-tree format
   - Maintained compatibility with CustomTreeNode component
   - Removed unnecessary data transformation logic

### Technical Implementation:
- **Direct Compatibility**: Server returns exact format needed by react-d3-tree
- **Multiple Layers**: Fetches complete tree hierarchy recursively 
- **Performance**: Single tRPC call gets entire tree structure
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing products in tree
- **Data Completeness**: All product attributes available in tree nodes

### Files modified:
- `src/server/routers/product.ts` - Created `getSupplierTree` procedure
- `src/api/product.ts` - Added `useGetSupplierTree` hook
- `src/components/management/supplier-tree-view.tsx` - Updated to use new data structure

### Data Flow:
1. Component calls `useGetSupplierTree(rootProductId)`
2. Server recursively fetches all children using `children_ids`
3. Returns complete tree in react-d3-tree format
4. Component passes data directly to `<Tree data={[supplierTree]} />`

### Build status: ✅ SUPPLIER TREE OPTIMIZED
- Single tRPC call returns complete react-d3-tree compatible structure
- Multi-layer recursive tree fetching working
- No client-side data transformation needed
- Ready for production use

## Recursive Product Tree Fetching Implementation (Completed - August 1, 2025)

### What was done:
1. **Implemented Complete Recursive Tree Fetching**: Added full recursive product tree fetching functionality using tRPC:
   - Created new `getCompleteProductTree` procedure in `src/server/routers/product.ts`
   - Implements recursive fetching that follows `childrenIds` until no more children exist
   - Includes loop prevention with visited set to avoid infinite recursion
   - Fetches complete product hierarchy with all nested children

2. **Updated Supplier Tree View Component**: Modified `supplier-tree-view.tsx` to use the new recursive fetching:
   - Replaced synchronous hierarchy building with `useGetCompleteProductTree` hook
   - Automatically fetches complete tree when root product is selected
   - Displays loading states and error handling
   - Maintains compatibility with existing tree display logic

3. **Added New tRPC Hook**: Created `useGetCompleteProductTree` hook in `src/api/product.ts`:
   - Uses tRPC query pattern with proper enabled condition
   - Returns complete tree data with loading and error states
   - Follows established API conventions

### Technical Implementation:
- **Server-side Recursion**: Recursive function `fetchProductWithChildren` on server
- **Loop Prevention**: Uses visited set to prevent infinite recursion
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing or inaccessible products
- **Performance**: Single tRPC call fetches entire tree structure
- **Data Transformation**: Proper transformation from database to frontend types

### Files modified:
- `src/server/routers/product.ts` - Added `getCompleteProductTree` procedure
- `src/api/product.ts` - Added `useGetCompleteProductTree` hook
- `src/components/management/supplier-tree-view.tsx` - Updated to use recursive fetching

### Build status: ✅ RECURSIVE TREE WORKING
- Single tRPC call fetches complete product hierarchy
- Displays full tree with all nested children recursively
- Proper loading states and error handling implemented
- Ready for production use

## tRPC Migration for Tree Views (Completed - August 1, 2025)

### What was done:
1. **Fixed Tree View API Migration**: Successfully migrated tree view components from axios REST API to tRPC:
   - Fixed `supplier-tree-view.tsx` to remove old `getProductById` calls
   - Fixed `brand-tree-view.tsx` to remove old API calls
   - Replaced async API fetching with synchronous hierarchy building using available product data
   - Removed recursive API calls that violated tRPC hook rules

2. **Key Changes**:
   - Removed `fetchChildrenRecursively` and `fetchDirectParents` functions that used direct API calls
   - Implemented `buildHierarchySync` function that works with already-loaded product data
   - Added tracking for missing product IDs for future batch fetching implementation
   - Updated both components to display trees with currently available data only

3. **Technical Approach**:
   - Used tRPC hooks pattern following the API instructions
   - Built hierarchical structures synchronously from loaded product data
   - Added placeholders for future batch product fetching using tRPC
   - Maintained tree functionality while removing problematic API calls

### Files modified:
- `src/components/management/supplier-tree-view.tsx` - Fixed tRPC migration
- `src/components/management/brand-tree-view.tsx` - Fixed tRPC migration

### Build status: ✅ TREE VIEWS WORKING
- No TypeScript errors in tree view components
- Tree components now properly use tRPC pattern
- Single root node with recursive children/parent display working
- Ready for further enhancement with batch product fetching

   - Converts all numeric SERIAL PRIMARY KEY columns to UUID v5
   - Handles all foreign key relationships
   - Includes error handling for existing indexes and constraints
   - Safe to run multiple times (idempotent operations)

2. **Product Hierarchy Restructure**: 
   - Changed from `parent_id` model to `children_ids` array model
   - Updated all API functions to build hierarchical trees using the new structure
   - Modified product types to support the new architecture

3. **UI Components Updated**:
   - Refactored `ProductTreeView` component to use `react-d3-tree` library
   - Updated from nested list to interactive D3 tree visualization
   - Fixed all TypeScript errors across the application
