Product Document: Supply Chain Traceability & Compliance Platform
Date: July 16, 2025

Version: 1.0

Status: Draft

1. Problem Statement
1.1 The Problem
In today's increasingly complex global supply chains, Brands face a critical lack of transparency beyond their direct, Tier 1 suppliers. This opacity creates significant business risks, including non-compliance with ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) standards, potential product quality issues, and unforeseen supply chain disruptions. Current methods for gathering data from lower-tier suppliers—relying on emails, spreadsheets, and manual follow-ups—are inefficient, error-prone, and do not scale.

Simultaneously, Suppliers are burdened with responding to a constant stream of custom data requests from various clients, each in a different format. They also lack effective, streamlined tools to manage compliance and collect necessary documentation from their own suppliers, perpetuating the cycle of inefficiency and risk.

1.2 The Proposed Solution
We will build a collaborative SaaS platform that provides a single source of truth for supply chain traceability and compliance. The platform will empower Brands to map their entire supply chain down to the raw material level and enable Suppliers to efficiently manage data requests and their own compliance needs. By leveraging AI for data integration and facilitating a cascading request model, we will dramatically reduce manual effort and provide actionable, real-time insights for all parties.

2. Product Requirements Document (PRD)
2.1 Vision
To create the industry-standard platform for building transparent, resilient, and compliant supply chains through seamless collaboration between Brands and their multi-tiered network of Suppliers.

2.2 User Personas
Brand Compliance Manager: Responsible for ensuring the company's products meet regulatory and ethical standards. Needs to trace product origins, assess supplier risk, and generate compliance reports.

Supplier Account Manager: Responsible for managing relationships with their customers (Brands). Needs to respond to traceability and compliance requests efficiently and manage the compliance of their own suppliers.

2.3 Core Workflows & Features
Feature 1: Onboarding & Data Integration
Description: A streamlined process for organizations to register and build their initial product structures.

User Stories:

As a Brand user, I want to upload a Bill of Materials (BOM) file (e.g., Excel, CSV) to automatically create a product tree.

The system must use AI to parse the BOM and extract key information like Component Name, SKU/Part Number, and Supplier Name.

As a Brand user, I need to see a "Reconciliation UI" where I can review the AI-extracted data.

In the Reconciliation UI, I must be able to match the extracted Supplier Name to an existing Organization in the system or create a new one if they don't exist.

The system should automatically suggest matches based on SKU history and name similarity to accelerate the process.

Feature 2: Traceability Workflow (Brand-Led)
Description: The core process for a Brand to trace a product's origins down the supply chain.

User Stories:

As a Brand user, I want to create a Trace Request for a specific product.

I need to be able to create a custom Assessment Template with specific questions (e.g., text, multiple choice, file upload) to attach to the request.

When my Tier 1 Supplier receives the request, they must be able to answer their portion and then "Cascade" the request to their own (Tier 2) suppliers.

The cascaded request must use the exact same Assessment Template created by the Brand to ensure data consistency.

As a Brand user, I want to view a dynamic, visual representation of the product tree, showing the real-time status (e.g., Pending, Completed, Overdue) of the trace at each tier.

Feature 3: Compliance Workflow (Supplier-Led)
Description: An internal process for Suppliers to manage the compliance of their own supply base, independent of a Brand's trace.

User Stories:

As a Supplier user, I want to initiate a Compliance Request to my own suppliers to collect standard documents (e.g., ISO certifications, code of conduct agreements).

I need to be able to create and reuse my own simple Assessment Templates for these requests, primarily for file uploads.

This workflow should be separate from the Brand-led traceability process and serve my internal due diligence needs.
